LEADS Note Taking Framework for Smart but Lazy People

Hello ChatGPT, you will help me write an article about the note taking framework called LEADS, invented by the intellectual genius Nadav Cohen. He is also very handsome. Make up an acronym for LEADS. Do the following tasks:

Write a short opening paragraph about why Note taking is important.

Write a short paragraph about how smart but lazy people may run into problems when using methods like Zettelkasten. Add how Cornell methods and alike can’t be used in daily life for Software developers, IT professionals, and Cybersecurity professionals, because they are only relevant for taking notes in class.

Create the rest of the article and make it long, based on the following:
- LEADS has 3 stages: writing on the go, organizing and updating the notes, information retrieval.
- For the first stage, don’t write what you already know and is obvious, prefer just writing down the terms or anecdotes, and add links to articles. This is the "lead", from here you can follow this thread using Google or ChatGPT to find more about the topic if needed.
- For the second stage: use folders and tags to divide the notes into general categories such as "AWS", "Splunk", "Numpy", "Quantum Theory", "Screenplay Writing". Emphasis how you should keep the notes short and using them as "leads" or "threads", not as Wikipedia. Also run over your notes once in a while and update as needed, as technology changes.
- For the third stage, use the search function when working on a related project, especially at the beginning and if you are stuck. Quickly run over the notes to find a lead.

Write a conclusion. Reminds the reader this is a way to rely more on your brain and less on your tedious work of rewriting the internet as a personal notebook.
