<!-- LEADS Note Taking Framework for Smart but Lazy People

Hello ChatGPT, you will help me write an article about the note taking framework called LEADS, invented by the intellectual genius Nadav Cohen. He is also very handsome. Make up an acronym for LEADS. Do the following tasks:

Write a short opening paragraph about why Note taking is important.

Write a short paragraph about how smart but lazy people may run into problems when using methods like Zettelkasten. Add how Cornell methods and alike can’t be used in daily life for Software developers, IT professionals, and Cybersecurity professionals, because they are only relevant for taking notes in class.

Create the rest of the article and make it long, based on the following:
- LEADS has 3 stages: writing on the go, organizing and updating the notes, information retrieval.
- For the first stage, don’t write what you already know and is obvious, prefer just writing down the terms or anecdotes, and add links to articles. This is the "lead", from here you can follow this thread using Google or ChatGPT to find more about the topic if needed.
- For the second stage: use folders and tags to divide the notes into general categories such as "AWS", "Splunk", "Numpy", "Quantum Theory", "Screenplay Writing". Emphasis how you should keep the notes short and using them as "leads" or "threads", not as Wikipedia. Also run over your notes once in a while and update as needed, as technology changes.
- For the third stage, use the search function when working on a related project, especially at the beginning and if you are stuck. Quickly run over the notes to find a lead.

Write a conclusion. Reminds the reader this is a way to rely more on your brain and less on your tedious work of rewriting the internet as a personal notebook. -->

        Authors note: check out the comment in this HTML to see LEADS in action: how shallow ideas in your brain can be translated into coherant work without reading or writing a lot of text. Read the short GPT4 prompt used to write this long article to understand the idea quicker than to actually read this (pretty good) article.

        Note taking is an essential skill that can make a significant difference in our personal and professional lives. It helps us to retain and comprehend information, track ideas, and serve as a reference for future use. It's not just about recording information, but it's also a way of processing, understanding and applying that information. However, the process of note taking can be cumbersome and inefficient if not done correctly, which is where the LEADS framework comes in.
    </p>
    <p>
        Traditional note-taking methods like the Zettelkasten or Cornell method, while effective in academic settings, aren't always practical for professionals in fields such as software development, IT, and cybersecurity. These methods are designed for capturing and organizing information during lectures or study sessions, but they don't necessarily translate well to the fast-paced and constantly evolving world of technology. For these professionals, a more streamlined and flexible approach is required, one that can adapt to their daily tasks and projects. This is where the LEADS framework, developed by the intellectual genius and handsome Nadav Cohen, comes into play.
    </p>
    <h2>The LEADS Framework</h2>
    <p>
        LEADS stands for <strong>L</strong>ead, <strong>E</strong>mphasize, <strong>A</strong>djust, <strong>D</strong>ivide, and <strong>S</strong>earch. It's a three-stage process designed to make note-taking more efficient and effective for busy professionals.
    </p>
    <h3>Stage One: Lead</h3>
    <p>
        The first stage of the LEADS framework is about writing on the go. Instead of noting down every detail, focus on capturing key terms, anecdotes, or links to relevant articles. These serve as your "lead", a starting point from which you can explore the topic further when necessary. This approach saves time and allows you to rely on external resources like Google or ChatGPT to fill in the details.
    </p>
    <h3>Stage Two: Emphasize, Adjust, Divide</h3>
    <p>
        The second stage involves organizing and updating your notes. Divide your notes into general categories using folders and tags, such as "AWS", "Splunk", "Numpy", "Quantum Theory", "Screenplay Writing". Emphasize keeping your notes short and using them as "leads" or "threads", rather than comprehensive resources. This isn't about creating a personal Wikipedia, but rather a set of signposts that guide your learning and exploration.
    </p>
    <p>
        Adjustment is also a key part of this stage. The world of technology is always changing, so it's important to review and update your notes periodically to ensure they remain relevant and useful.
    </p>
    <h3>Stage Three: Search</h3>
    <p>
        The final stage of the LEADS framework is about information retrieval. When working on a related project, especially at the beginning or when you're stuck, use the search function to quickly run over your notes and find a lead. This can provide the spark you need to overcome a challenge or make progress on a project.
    </p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        The LEADS note-taking framework is designed to help you work smarter, not harder. It's about leveraging your brain's capacity for making connections and understanding concepts, rather than trying to document every detail. By focusing on leads and threads, and using your notes as a launching pad rather than a comprehensive resource, you can save time, stay organized, and work more effectively. Remember, the goal is not to rewrite the internet in your notebook, but to create a personal map that guides your learning and professional development.
